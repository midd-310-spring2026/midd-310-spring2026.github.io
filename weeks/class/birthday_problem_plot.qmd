Suppose we have $k$ people in a room. Define event $A$ as the event at least two people in the room share the same birthday. What is $P(A)$?

Assumptions:

-   "same birthday" here means same month and day
-   We don't have twins/triplets/etc.
-   No one born on February 29 (leap year)
-   Each day of the year is equally likely to be a birthday

```{r echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
library(tidyverse)

prob <- rep(NA, 60); prob[1] <- 0
for(k in 2:60){
  prob[k] <- 1 - prod((365 - k + 1):365)/365^k
}
data.frame(k = 1:60, probability = prob) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = k, y = probability)) + 
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  ggtitle("Probability of at least one birthday match") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, col = "orange", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "n") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 20))
```
